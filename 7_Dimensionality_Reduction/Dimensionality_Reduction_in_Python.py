# Seaborn's pairplot is excellent to visually explore small to medium sized datasets. One by one comparison of each numeric feature in the dataset in the form of a scatterplot plus, diagonally, a view of the distribution of each feature

# Visually detecting redundant features
# Data visualization is a crucial step in any data exploration. Let's use Seaborn to explore some samples of the US Army ANSUR body measurement dataset.
#
# Two data samples have been pre-loaded as ansur_df_1 and ansur_df_2.
#
# Seaborn has been imported as sns.

# Create a pairplot and color the points using the 'Gender' feature
sns.pairplot(ansur_df_1, hue='Gender', diag_kind='hist')

# Show the plot

# Correct! Extracted features can be quite hard to interpret.

# t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
# Powerful technique to visualize high dimensional data using feature extraction

# Before we apply t-SNE we are going to remove all non-numeric columns by passing a list with the unwanted column names to the pandas df

# t-SNE does not work with non-numeric data as such

# Fitting t-SNE to the ANSUR data
# t-SNE is a great technique for visual exploration of high dimensional datasets. In this exercise, you'll apply it to the ANSUR dataset. You'll remove non-numeric columns from the pre-loaded dataset df and fit TSNE to his numeric dataset.

# Drop the non-numeric columns from the dataset.
# Create a TSNE model with learning rate 50.
# Fit and transform the model on the numeric dataset.

# Non-numerical columns in the dataset
non_numeric = ['Branch', 'Gender', 'Component']

# Drop the non-numerical columns from df
df_numeric = df.drop(non_numeric, axis=1)

# Create a t-SNE model with learning rate 50
m = TSNE(learning_rate=50)

# Fit and transform the t-SNE model on the numeric dataset
tsne_features = m.fit_transform(df_numeric)
print(tsne_features)

# t-SNE visualisation of dimensionality
# Time to look at the results of your hard work. In this exercise, you will visualize the output of t-SNE dimensionality reduction on the combined male and female Ansur dataset. You'll create 3 scatterplots of the 2 t-SNE features ('x' and 'y') which were added to the dataset df. In each scatterplot you'll color the points according to a different categorical variable.
#
# seaborn has already been imported as sns and matplotlib.pyplot as plt.

# Use seaborn's sns.scatterplot to create the plot.
# Color the points by 'Component'.

# Color the points according to Army Component
sns.scatterplot(x="x", y="y", hue='Component', data=df)

# Show the plot

# Color the points of the scatterplot by 'Branch'.

# Color the points by Army Branch

# If we want to know whether our model overfitted to the dataset we can have a look at the accuracy on the training set. If this accuracy is much higher than that on the test set we can conclude that the model did not generalize well but simply memorized all training examples
# If we want to improve the accuracy of the model we ll have to add features to the dataset

# To avoid overfitting, the nr of observations should increase exponentially with the number of features. Since this becomes really problematic for high dimensional datasets, this phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality. Thus we apply dimensionality reduction

# Train - test split
# In this chapter, you will keep working with the ANSUR dataset. Before you can build a model on your dataset, you should first decide on which feature you want to predict. In this case, you're trying to predict gender.
#
# You need to extract the column holding this feature from the dataset and then split the data into a training and test set. The training set will be used to train the model and the test set will be used to check its performance on unseen data.

# Import the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.
# Assign the 'Gender' column to y.
# Remove the 'Gender' column from the dataframe and assign the result to X.

# Fitting and testing the model
# In the previous exercise, you split the dataset into X_train, X_test, y_train, and y_test. These datasets have been pre-loaded for you. You'll now create a support vector machine classifier model (SVC()) and fit that to the training data. You'll then calculate the accuracy on both the test and training set to detect overfitting.

# Well done! Looks like the model badly overfits on the training data. On unseen data it performs worse than a random selector would.

# Accuracy after dimensionality reduction
# You'll reduce the overfit with the help of dimensionality reduction. In this case, you'll apply a rather drastic form of dimensionality reduction by only selecting a single column that has some good information to distinguish between genders. You'll repeat the train-test split, model fit and prediction steps to compare the accuracy on test vs. training data.

# Let's improve the balance between predictive power and model simplicity by tweaking the alpha parameter.

# Good job! Inluding the Lasso linear model from the previous exercise, we now have the votes from 3 models on which features are important.

# We'll combine the votes of the 3 models you built in the previous exercises, to decide which features are important into a meta mask. We'll then use this mask to reduce dimensionality and see how a simple linear regressor performs on the reduced dataset.
#
# The per model votes have been pre-loaded as lcv_mask, rf_mask, and gb_mask and the feature and target datasets as X and y.

# Sum the votes of the three models using np.sum().

# For PCA it's important to scale the features first so that their values are easier to compare

# Manual feature extraction I
# You want to compare prices for specific products between stores. The features in the pre-loaded dataset sales_df are: storeID, product, quantity and revenue. The quantity and revenue features tell you how many items of a particular product were sold in a store and what the total revenue was. For the purpose of your analysis it's more interesting to know the average price per product.

# Calculate the product price from the quantity sold and total revenue.
# Drop the quantity and revenue features from the dataset.

# Calculate the price from the quantity sold and revenue
sales_df['price'] = sales_df['revenue'] / sales_df['quantity']

# Drop the quantity and revenue features
reduced_df = sales_df.drop(['quantity', 'revenue'], axis=1)

# Manual feature extraction II
# You're working on a variant of the ANSUR dataset, height_df, where a person's height was measured 3 times. Add a feature with the mean height to the dataset and then drop the 3 original features.

# Add a feature with the mean height to the dataset. Use the .mean() method with axis=1.
# Drop the 3 original height features from the dataset.

# Calculate the mean height
height_df['height'] = height_df[['height_1', 'height_2', 'height_3']].mean(axis=1)

# Drop the 3 original height features
reduced_df = height_df.drop(['height_1', 'height_2', 'height_3'], axis=1)

# When you are dealing with a dataset with a lot of correlation, the explained variance typically becomes concentrated in the first few components. The remaining components then explain so little variance that they can be dropped

# If you have a lot of highly correlated features, then PCA :-D

# Calculating Principal Components
# You'll visually inspect a 4 feature sample of the ANSUR dataset before and after PCA using Seaborn's pairplot(). This will allow you to inspect the pairwise correlations between the features.
#
# The data has been pre-loaded for you as ansur_df.

# PCA on a larger dataset
# You'll now apply PCA on a somewhat larger ANSUR datasample with 13 dimensions, once again pre-loaded as ansur_df. The fitted model will be used in the next exercise. Since we are not using the principal components themselves there is no need to transform the data, instead, it is sufficient to fit pca to the data.
