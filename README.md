datacamp machine learning scientist track

This is my rep where I cumulate the solutions and pdfs from the datacamp ML track. 
The structure (once I am done) will follow with pdf files for each chapter slidedeck and a dedicated Jupyter-nb per chapter, hence 23.

Thanks for waiting for the latter.;)
